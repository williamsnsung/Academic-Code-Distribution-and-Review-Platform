# Junior Honours Project 2021-2022 - Deliverable 4

Deadline: Thursday 31st March 2022, 9pm


## Requirements for Deliverable 4

The purpose of this final deliverable is to provide the final implementation
of your JH project, with an accompanying report.

Your group report should cover (but is not limited to) the following parts,
along with the features described in the report structure given in the 
[Student Handbook](https://info.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/student-handbook/course-specific/honours.html#Junior_Honours_Project).

* An overview of how you followed the Scrum / Agile development model, along
  with a discussion of where you feel it went well and where it went badly,
  and what you would change in projects you do in future.
* The implemented functionality of your system, including any testing of your
  functionality you have performed. Also discuss any features you implemented
  which make use of supergroup communications.
* How your plans have changed since Deliverables 2 and 3 (changes in plan will
  not be considered a problem or mistake).
* A discussion of how your group has interacted with the supergroup.


### Deliverable structure

Each student should submit the **complete final version of the code**,
a **group report** and a short **individual report**.

The group report and the **complete final version of the code** should
be identical in each group member's submission.

The **complete final version of the code** should include the source code
together with the `.hg` or `.git` directory containing the revisions history
of the project. It should also include a `README.md` or `README.txt` file
with a brief description of the project, software dependencies, installation
instructions, and any other relevant details (e.g. quick start instructions;
known problems; troubleshooting tips etc.).

A description of how **the group report** should be structured is given in the 
[Student Handbook](https://info.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/student-handbook/course-specific/honours.html#Junior_Honours_Project).

You may include links to external documents such as weekly meeting reports
in your document, and these will not count towards the word limit.

Each section of the progress report should have a named individual lead
author, who takes responsibility for editing the final version of the
text of that section and ensuring that it complies with Good Academic
Practice. Each group member is expected to take responsibility for at
least one section of the report. You may use input provided by other
group members, in which cases you have to mention them as contributors.

Finally, each student must submit a short **individual report** which
should describe your own contribution to the group work, reflect on your
experience, and summarise how you worked together as a team. It should
cover the following questions:

* how the work was distributed between the group members?
* to which parts of the implementation did you contribute, and how?
* to which parts of the progress report did you contribute, and how?
* how did you organise your own work?
* what did you feel went well, in your own work, as well as in the group work?
* what did you find challenging?
* what problems did you encounter, if any, and how did you try to resolve those?
* what would you do differently, if anything?
* any other relevant information and special circumstances.

The advisory word limit for the individual report is 1000 words. 

Both group and individual reports should be submitted in PDF format.


### Demonstration

You will be expected to demonstrate your final system to the project
coordinator and your supervisor. This will either be via a live meeting,
on Teams, or if necessary, by preparing a video.

We will also organise demonstration session for each supergroup, for you
to demonstrate how supergroup communication works.


## Marking guidelines

This deliverable will be marked using the following mark descriptors:

* **0-6** Acceptable code for only a small part of the project or a report
  failing to be competent summary of the basic features of the project.
* **7-10** Code featuring a significant part of the project objectives and 
  a report demonstrating some understanding of the project.
* **11-13** A competent report addressing most of the project and code 
  achieving most of the basic requirements of the project.
* **14-16** Clear and well structured code achieving almost all required 
  functionality and a report showing comprehensive grasp of the subject 
  matter and the underlying principles, independent research; with clear

* **17-18** Clear, well-designed code featuring full functionality along
