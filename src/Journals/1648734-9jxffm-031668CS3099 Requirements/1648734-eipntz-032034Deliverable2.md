# Junior Honours Project 2021-2022 - Deliverable 2

Deadline: Friday 12th November, 9pm

### Requirements

The purpose of this second deliverable is to provide a progress report, and
"Minimum Viable Product" to demonstrate that you will be able to
implement the goals of the project. Your report should include a brief
discussion (maximum 6 pages) of your progress this semester, including

- Evidence you have followed the Scrum / Agile development model (including
  your weekly progress reports). 
- The currently implemented functionality of your system.
- Any significant changes you have made from your plans laid out in your first
  deliverable along with a brief discussion/justification (changes in plan will
  not be considered a problem or mistake).
- A brief discussion of how your group has interacted with the supergroup.

You may include documents such as weekly meeting reports, user stories, or
protocol and feature descriptions, in appendices to your document, and these
will not count towards the page limit.

Each section of the submission should have a named individual lead author (use
your matriculation number for this in the document), who takes responsibility
for editing the text of that section and ensuring that it complies with Good
Academic Practice.

### Minimum Viable Product

The term "minimum viable product" in this context means providing a very
limited implementation of the major pieces of functionality you expect to need.
This should include your progress towards (but is not limited to):

* Ability to register users
* Posting new source code files
* Posting comments on source code files
* A simple, web-based user interface
* An implementation of a protocol for sharing user information and migrating
  content between coding journals

In this deliverable, it is much more important your system can do these things
*correctly*, than that they are done in a user-friendly way, or that all
optional features are implemented. In particular you are *not* expected to have
completed any user study of any kind.

This report should not discuss any future plans you have.

### Demonstration

You will demonstrate your system functioning at one of your regular meetings
with your supervisor. The demonstration will not be explicitly marked, but will
be used to check you have implemented the functionality you discuss in your
report.

## Marking for Deliverable 2

Each student should submit a shared report representing the work of the whole
group along with a short (1/2 page max) individual report, briefly discussing
who did what, and any special circumstances.

This deliverable will be marked using the following mark descriptors:

* **0-6** Little evidence of any progress on the project plan, or discussion of
  the project.
* **7-10** A report demonstrating minor progress, with no evidence of Scrum and
  no practical functionality.
* **11-13** A competent progress report addressing most of the requirements
  above, with basic use of Scrum and evidence of basic functionality of the
  project.
* **14-16** A good progress report with good discussion of the use of Scrum,
  and at least the ability to register users and post source code files
  (without migrating submissions between coding journals).
* **17-18** An excellent report with a high-quality discussion of progress,
  good engineering and Scrum, and a complete "minimum viable product"
  demonstrating a very basic version of all the required pieces of
  functionality for the project.
* **19-20** An exceptional report and an excellent demonstration, with all
  required functionality and one or more features implemented to a high
  standard.

## Lateness

The standard penalty for late submission applies (Scheme B: 1 mark per 8 hour
period, or part thereof):
