# Junior Honours Project 2021-2022 - Deliverable 3

Deadline: Wednesday 16th February 2022, 9pm


## Requirements for Deliverable 3

The purpose of this third deliverable is to provide a progress report. Your 
report should include a brief discussion (maximum 6 pages) of your progress
so far achieved after the submission of Deliverable 3. This should include:

* Continued evidence you have followed Scrum / Agile development model
  (including your weekly progress reports). 
* A description of currently implemented functionality of your system.
* Any changes you have made, based on either the feedback for Deliverable 2 or
  progress this semester (changes in plan will not be considered a problem or
  mistake).
* A brief discussion of how your group has interacted with the supergroup.
* An outline of how you intend to progress for the rest of the semester.

You may include appendices such as weekly meeting reports, or protocol
specifications, in your progress report. These will not count towards
the page limit.

Each section of the progress report should have a named individual lead
author, who takes responsibility for editing the final version of the
text of that section and ensuring that it complies with Good Academic
Practice. Each group member is expected to take responsibility for at
least one section of the report. You may use input provided by other
group members, in which cases you have to mention them as contributors.


## Deliverable structure

Each student should submit a group report and an individual report.

The group report is the final version of the progress report as outlined
above, representing the work of the whole group. This document should be
identical in each group member's submission.

The individual report should describe your own contribution to the group
work, reflect on your experience, and summarise how you worked together
as a team. It should cover the following questions:

* how the work was distributed between the group members?
* to which parts of the implementation did you contribute, and how?
* to which parts of the progress report did you contribute, and how?
* how did you organise your own work?
* what did you feel went well, in your own work, as well as in the group work?
* what did you find challenging?
* what problems did you encounter, if any, and how did you try to resolve those?
* what would you do differently, if anything?
* any other relevant information. 

The advisory word limit for the individual report is 1000 words. 

Both reports should be submitted in PDF format.


### Demonstration

You should plan to show your group supervisor your progress achieved so
far this semester, and discuss how you will progress in the remaining weeks
until the end of the semester.
