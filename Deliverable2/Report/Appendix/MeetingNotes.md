# Meeting Notes

## Supervisor Meeting 1

1. Meetings are largely up to the team
2. Supervisor basically watches to see how the team is proceeding
   1. Making sure everyone is doing enough work and not doing too much work
3. Try to come up with a kind of scenario, more than a user story, a sequence of events a potential user might go through whilst using your program from start to finish
4. Not a kind of system we would have used before, a challenge of SE, we have to work out someone else’s tool that you wouldn’t necessarily use yourself
5. Sometimes authors and reviewers may want to be anonymous
6. Code reviews here will be pretty heavy weight
   1. More formal, in depth
7. Academic peer review but for code rather than papers
8. Code review tends to be internal to a team for SE, whereas here it would go into a journal of record
9. Let him know if you can’t turn up to a meeting
10. Every Friday at 11am

## Supervisor Meeting 2

Things to include in the report:

1. Choice of tools and Language
2.  How we intend on managing product backlog
3. How we are going to manage communication with each other – documentation and wiki; ensure the team are aware of down time from members
